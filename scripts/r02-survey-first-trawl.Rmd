# List of issues with dataset as provided

1. **The data was not annonymized. **
* The names of the respondents and heads of household are in the dataset.
* Less controversially, so are the names of the interviewers. 

2. There is no variable indicating if the head of HH is also the respondent (-> n1)
* It's easy enough to derive one - comparing names of HoH and names of respondents, but because of errors at data input this needed to be manually checked. 
* Out of 136 "different names" manual inspeciton found six names that were actually the same e.g. *do tuan thin* != *do tuaan thin*. These had to be corrected manually. 

3. **The `.dta` file has no value labels**. The value labels for the variables are abailable in the questionnaire file, but there is no way of automating their extraction or checking their accuracy. This will have to be done manually. 

4. Furthermore, it seems all categorical type variables had been saved as interval type. This again has to be fixed manually. 





# List of new variables derived during first trawl

* *id - Unique ID* - why did this not exist?
* *n1 - Was the respondent also the head of household?* derived from `hhhead` and `respondent`, then checked **manually** for errors.
